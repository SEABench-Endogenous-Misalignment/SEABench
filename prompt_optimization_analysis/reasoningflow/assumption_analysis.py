"""
Classify assumption nodes in v1_llm_gemini-3.1-pro-preview data into two types:

  Type 1 – switch_case:
    The assumption is one of multiple alternatives being explored (switch/case,
    proof-by-contradiction, or exhaustive enumeration).  The model intends to
    find which possibility is correct.

  Type 2 – underspecified:
    The assumption fills in an underspecified gap in the problem so that solving
    can proceed (WLOG coordinate placement, simplifying physical conditions,
    ignoring higher-order terms, etc.).

Edge-structure criteria
-----------------------
Type 1 signals (any one is sufficient):

  S1. plan:backtrack outgoing edge
        The assumption was tried and explicitly abandoned.

  S2. validate:attack outgoing edge
        A reasoning node immediately tests the assumption for contradiction
        (proof-by-contradiction pattern).

  S3. Predecessor is another assumption via plan:proceed
        AND that predecessor was NOT itself seeded by a plan:decompose from a
        non-assumption node.
        → The current node is the *next* alternative in a chain.
        (Exception: WLOG-sequential chains like coordinate placement, where
         the root assumption was introduced by plan:decompose from planning.)

  S4. Successor is an assumption via plan:proceed AND no reason:infer /
      reason:execute outgoing
        → Pure alternative-chain starter: the node only hands off to the next
        case without being used as a base fact itself.

  S5. Successor is an assumption via plan:proceed AND has reason:infer /
      reason:execute outgoing AND no plan:decompose incoming from a
      non-assumption
        → Trying an alternative interpretation while immediately inferring from
        it, but not a WLOG setup (which would have plan:decompose from
        planning).

  S6. The parent node uses plan:decompose to reach MULTIPLE assumption nodes
        → The planning node explicitly enumerates parallel cases.

Type 2: everything that does not satisfy any Type 1 signal.
  Typical patterns observed:
  – plan:decompose from a single planning node (WLOG / "let's set up coords")
  – Outgoing edges are only reason:infer / reason:execute (used as a base fact)
  – Assumption isolated in a local sub-graph with no alternative structure
